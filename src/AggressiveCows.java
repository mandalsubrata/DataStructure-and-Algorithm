/**
 * Farmer John has built a new long barn with N stalls. 
 * Given an array of integers A of size N where each element of the array represents 
 * the location of the stall and an integer B which represents the number of cows.
 * His cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once 
 * put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, John wants to assign 
 * the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as 
 * large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?
 * 
 * Problem Constraints
 * 2 <= N <= 100000
 * 0 <= A[i] <= 109
 * 2 <= B <= N
 *
 * The first argument given is the integer array A.
 * The second argument given is the integer B.
 *
 * Input
 * A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * B = 3
 *
 * Output: 2
